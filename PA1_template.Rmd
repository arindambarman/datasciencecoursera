This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
act<-data.frame(read.csv("C:/Users/arindam/Documents/Data Science/R Programming/Assignment Reproduceable Research/activity.csv",colClasses = c("numeric", "Date", "numeric")))
actaggr<-aggregate(act$steps,by=list(act$date), FUN=sum,na.rm=TRUE)
plot(actaggr$Group.1,actaggr$x,type="h")

```

## summary information for datafile

```{r}
summary(actaggr$x)
plot(act$interval,act$steps, plot="l")
```
## Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r}
maxstep<-aggregate(act$steps, by=list(act$interval),FUN=sum,na.rm=TRUE)
max(maxstep$x)
subset(maxstep, x=="10927")


```
##  Count NA values & Imputing missing values-() strategy to fill the missin NA values with mean of all steps)
```{r}
sum(is.na(act$steps))
act[is.na(act)]<-mean(act$steps)

## Reporting daily aggregate steps and mean 
actaggr<-aggregate(act$steps,by=list(act$date), mean)

## Reporting daily aggregate steps and median 
actaggr<-aggregate(act$steps,by=list(act$date), median)

## plotting daily data in histogram
actaggr<-aggregate(act$steps,by=list(act$date), FUN=sum)
plot(actaggr$Group.1,actaggr$x,type="h")

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
act$day <- factor(ifelse(as.POSIXlt(act$date)$wday %% 6 == 0, "Weekend", "Weekday"))
actaggr<-aggregate(act$steps,by=list(act$date,act$day), FUN=sum)
# plotting data for weekend and weekdays
library(lattice)
xyplot(x~Group.1|Group.2, data=actaggr,type="l",xlab="Interval",ylab="steps")


```
